        <p><em>Web developer.</em></p>
        <p>I am a self taught web developer. I love coffee, anime, and motorcycles.<p>
            <p> For eight years, I have worked in Austin at many different service industry jobs including upscale, fine dining and catering. Although I have enjoyed this time, I yearn for something bigger. I was always interested in the possibility
              of coding and made it my mission to become a web developer 2020.</p>
